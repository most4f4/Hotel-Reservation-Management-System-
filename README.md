# Hotel Reservation Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

This **Hotel Reservation Management System** is a JavaFX desktop application designed to simplify hotel operations including room booking, guest data management, and administrative oversight. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing reservations, guest feedback, billing, and room availability. The system includes both client-side and server-side components, with an admin interface for managing hotel operations and a guest interface for submitting feedback.
This project was developed as part of a university course to demonstrate proficiency in Java, JavaFX, database management, and client-server architecture.

## ✨ Features
